  ## Description

  Employee Manager is a program to help a business keep track of their employees, departments, roles, salaries, and managers. Business need to stay organized and this program will help with that.  This program uses MySQL database to keep your business organized. While building this project, I learned a lot about sing MySQL queries and navagating through tables. I learned about JOINs and CONCATs and SELECTs.
